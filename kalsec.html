    <p>I had the opportunity to intern at Kalsec, a company that specializes in natural flavor, color, and antioxidant ingredients for food. It was my first deep dive into industry research, and I walked away with a toolkit full of new skills and insights.</p>

    <h2>What I Did in the Lab</h2>
    <p>I worked closely with a lead scientist on a wet lab project involving thirteen proteins. I helped carry out the entire process: from transforming plasmids into competent cells to overexpressing and purifying the proteins. I also handled buffer exchange as part of the prep work, which was both detail-oriented and incredibly satisfying when it worked.</p>
    <p>Another area I explored was oxidation stability testing. I conducted over six experiments using something called the Oxidative Stability Index, which helped us evaluate how a specific compound slowed down oxidation in oil. This was a fun application of biochemistry in a very real-world context, food preservation.</p>
    <p>Additionally, my hands-on contributions also involved the Cu-CAS assay, a method for detecting siderophores. I helped prepare the media, handled incubation and extraction using resin beads and vacuum filtration, and freeze-dried the samples to analyze their purity. It felt like a full-circle research loop from setup to cleanup.</p>  

    <h2>What I Took Away</h2>
    <p>Working in an industry lab taught me how to stay organized, communicate clearly across teams, and troubleshoot on the way. I learned how science operates when it is aligned with product goals and business timelines.</p>
