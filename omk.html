    <p>Before I started diving deep into my current project, I explored a smaller side study focused on OMK cells, short for owl monkey kidney cells. The goal was to understand how well these cells grow under different lab conditions, specifically comparing suspension culture to the more traditional monolayer format.</p>

    <p>It was an exciting challenge at first. I tried different seeding densities, adjusted environmental conditions, and consulted with professors in the department to troubleshoot. One approach I tried involved using a surfactant to help prevent the cells from clumping together in suspension. We ran multiple trials, tweaking one variable at a time and carefully noting what worked and what didn’t.</p>

    <h2>What I Tried to Explore</h2>
    <p>I was curious about whether suspension conditions might offer more flexibility for downstream experiments. I looked into how the OMK cells attached, how they responded to passaging, and what might be interfering with their ability to grow in the medium. Each attempt came with new notes, questions, and a few more variables to think about.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned and Why We Paused</h2>
    <p>At the time, I was also leading another study that was gaining momentum, and it became clear I couldn’t give both the time they deserved. Talking with my mentor, we agreed to let this one go for now.</p>

    <p>But even though it didn’t lead to a final dataset or experiment, this experience helped me sharpen how I ask questions in the lab. It pushed me to think critically about experimental design, cell viability, and how to decide when to double down or step back. In a way, this little project taught me just as much as the bigger ones.</p>
